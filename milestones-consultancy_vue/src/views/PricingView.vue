              Put quite simply, if we do not feel we are best placed to provide you with
              what you need, we will say so and save you time and money. There is nothing
              to be gained by either party if we take on a commission without the
              necessary time and skills to do a professional job. We do not consider
              ourselves experts at everything but rely on your judgment on the kind of
              service we shall have provided. We believe that our clients and the
              community members are the experts and we endeavor to find that expertise in
              them through our people friendly consultancy tools.

              Whilst our standard charge is by the day, we do not charge for time which
              the client does not need. Therefore, if we are only asked for half a day's
              work, you will only pay for half a day.

              Our normal daily charge for Kenya based clients will be negotiated. This
              rate is the same for off-site preparation and research time as for on-site
              activities. Rates for work overseas will be negotiated on a case by case
              basis. For generally advertised development programmes where a client is
              booking one or more places, there will be a charge per delegate rather than
              a daily fee. Hotel accommodation train and air tickets, and other
              subsistence expenses incurred in respect of the consultant are charged at a
              cost.
